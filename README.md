# legacy-algorithm-comparison

This is a program that is used to compare speed of C, Fortran and Ada running their own verisons of the kmp search algorithm.

Just run `make` to generate an executable for each language.
You can run the script in C, Fortran or Ada by running `./kmp-c`, `./kmp-fortran` and `./kmp-ada` respectively.

You can also run `make clean` to clean up the directory.
